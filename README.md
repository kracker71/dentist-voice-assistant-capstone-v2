# Dentist Voice Assistant Web Application
Dentist Voice Assistant is a web application that assist dentists in performing periodontal assessment. In general, the dentists assess patients' mouth with both hands and they must remove their gloves to write down the periodontal value after appraising one tooth. The dentist's workflow is slowed as a result of this handicap. As a result, we have proposed using machine learning to mitigate the problems.
